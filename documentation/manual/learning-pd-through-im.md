# Learning PD with Instrument Maker



## What is PD (Pure Data)?

Pure Data (shortened to PD) is a dataflow programming language.

- Objects on-screen.
- Guitar pedal analogy.

### Background

PD was developed by Miller Puckette as an open source project.



## Anatomy of a Pure Data object

Each object has inlets and outlets.

## Instrument elements

Note/velocity vs. continuous controls

## Notes for experienced PD users

The Instrument Maker set of objects/abstractions are almost exclusively based on audio connections.

Separation of interface and code: users are not encouraged to use GUI objects at this stage.

## Examples
